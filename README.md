**Continuous Integration** is to merge the code into central repo automatically with lesser conflicts.

**Continuous Delivery** is actually the CI stage being approved, small sprints are created  for small features therefore all changes are automatically tested & build.

**Continuous Deployment** is continuous testing of each update and then automatically deployment into production environment.
