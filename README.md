## 3 methods of git reset are
  - soft reset:  files are kept and can be staged back automatically
  - mixed reset: files are reset and moved from git repo to local repo
  - hard reset:  completely destroy any changes in file and remove them from the local directory
  
## Define CI, Continuous Delivery & Continuous Deployment

**Continuous Integration** is to merge the code into central repo automatically with lesser conflicts.

**Continuous Delivery** is actually the CI stage being approved, small sprints are created  for small features therefore all changes are automatically tested & build.

**Continuous Deployment** is continuous testing of each update and then automatically deployment into production environment.

## Agile vs DevOps

**Agile** is a software developement method works on iterations while **Devops** is a continous, scalable and wide approach of software deployment.

## Git vs GitHub

**Git** is:
- a software 
- locally instaled
- commandline tool
- manages edits in git repo 

**GitHub** is:
- a service
- UI supported
- web hosted
- a space to upload Git repo

## Sages of Git

There are 3 stages of Git
	1- modified: changes has been made in the file but not committed into the database
	2- staged: a modified file is ready to go in next commit
	3- committed: modified data has been stored in your local database
Working Directory >> Staging Phase: a file has been staged
Staging Phase >> git Repo: a file has been committed
Git Repo >> Working Directory: Check out the file

Commands used for Git stages are:
 - git add
 - git status
 - git commit
 - git amend
 - git push
 - git pull
 - git reset
 - git checkout
 - git fetch
 - git merge
